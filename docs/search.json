    "text": "1 Introduction\nTitle: Investigating the Relationship Between Air Quality and Lung and Bronchus Cancer in the United States\nWhy Choose This Topic:\n\nPublic Health Impact: Lung and Bronchus is a leading cause of death globally, and its incidence is on the rise. Investigating the relationship between cancer and air quality can provide insights into environmental factors contributing to Lung and Bronchus cancer risk.\nEnvironmental Concerns: Air quality affects the health of millions of people. Poor air quality, characterized by pollutants like particulate matter (PM) has been associated with various health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.\nPolicy Implications: Understanding the link between air quality and Lung and Bronchus cancer can inform evidence-based policies and regulations aimed at reducing Lung and Bronchus cancer rates by improving air quality. This research can contribute to more effective public health strategies.\n\nQuestions we are interested in studying:\n\nWhether certain states have higher Lung and Bronchus cancer rate? What are the trends in Lung and Bronchus cancer incidence and air quality over time?\nDetermine if there are geographical areas in the United States with consistently poor air quality and elevated Lung and Bronchus cancer rates. Are there any outliers in terms of cancer incidence or air quality?\nWhether there is a statistically significant correlation between long-term exposure to poor air quality (measured by pollutants like PM2.5 and ozone) and the incidence of Lung and Bronchus cancer in different regions of the United States?\nDoes the relationship between air quality and Lung and Bronchus cancer rates change over time? Is the impact of air quality on cancer rates consistent across states?\n\nContext About the Measurement of Air Quality:\nWe would assess air quality using various measurements, including:\n\nDaily Ozone Concentrations Daily ozone concentrations in our dataset refer to the levels of ozone (O3) gas within 3 meters of the surface of the earth measured on a daily basis. Ozone is a reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms (O3), and it is a key component of Earth’s atmosphere. While ozone high in the stratosphere (stratospheric ozone) plays a crucial role in protecting us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, ozone at ground level (tropospheric ozone) is an air pollutant that can have health and environmental impacts.\nDaily PM2.5 Concentrations Daily PM2.5 concentrations refer to the levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air measured on a daily basis. PM2.5 refers to tiny airborne particles or aerosols with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These particles are so small that they can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, posing health risks to humans."

    "text": "2.1 Technical description\nData Source 1: The first dataset we use is the United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) from the CDC’s WONDER database(https://wonder.cdc.gov/cancer-v2020.HTML). It includes cancer incidence data for the United States. These data are collected and provided by the CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. From the previous archived Cancer Statistics data, we can tell that the dataset is updated each year. The data contains 9 variables, including location, year, age group, race, sex, ethnicity, leading cancer sites, cancer sites, and childhood cancers. Also, the dataset covers years 1999 to 2020, with the 2022 data submission released in 2023. For our research, we focus on data from 2001 to 2011, centering on specific variables states and Lung and Bronchus cancer counts among 100k people. The final dimension of the cancer data is 5918 * 11. This selection enables us to analyze trends and patterns relevant to our study’s objectives. However, the dataset presents a challenge in its usage: it does not allow direct downloading in CSV format. Instead, we must employ the website’s query feature to select desired columns and export them as a TXT file. To make this data compatible with our analytical tools, we use R to transform the file into a CSV format, facilitating efficient data manipulation and analysis. This conversion process is crucial for extracting meaningful insights from the dataset, which includes data on the total population, cancer incidence, and crude rates.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read.table(file = 'United States Cancer Statistics, 2002-2011 Incidence.txt', \n                   header = TRUE, \n                   fill = TRUE, \n                   strip.white = TRUE, \n                   sep = \"\")\ndata &lt;- data[, -ncol(data)]\nnames(data)[ncol(data)] &lt;- 'Crude Rate'\nwrite_csv(data, 'cancer.csv')\n\n\nData Source 2: Daily PM2.5 Concentrations All County, 2001-2016 LINK: https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-PM2-5-Concentrations-All-County-2001-2016/7vdq-ztk9 This data set is collected by CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. It provides modeled predictions of PM2.5 levels from the EPA’s Downscaler model. Data are at the county level for year 2001-2016. The dataset includes the maximum, median, mean, and population-weighted mean of 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration in μg/m3. This data set is in csv format. It was created on March 25, 2020 and last updated on January 21, 2021. Original Data Dimension: 18.2M rows and 8 columns. Since this dataset is too large, I wouldn’t be able to directly download and import from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Also, to compare with cancer incidence over time, it’s better to let both datasets have the same time division (i.e., by year) and same geographical division(i.e., by state), it ensures consistency in the temporal granularity of the data. Thus, I will first group by year and state and aggregate on the PM25_max_pred and PM25_pop_pred columns to make the row number smaller using the query tools on the website and then import using API endpoint.\n\n\nCode\npm &lt;- read.csv(\"https://data.cdc.gov/resource/7vdq-ztk9.csv?$query=SELECT%0A%20%20%60year%60%2C%0A%20%20%60statefips%60%2C%0A%20%20max(%60pm25_max_pred%60)%20AS%20%60max_pm25_max_pred%60%2C%0A%20%20avg(%60pm25_pop_pred%60)%20AS%20%60avg_pm25_pop_pred%60%0AGROUP%20BY%20%60year%60%2C%20%60statefips%60\")\n\n\nData Source 3: Daily County-Level Ozone Concentrations, 2001-2016 LINK: https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-County-Level-Ozone-Concentrations-2001-2016/kmf5-t9yc This data set is collected by CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. Data are at the county levels for years 2001-2014. The dataset includes the maximum, median, mean, and population-weighted mean estimated 8-hour average ozone concentration in parts per billion (ppb) within 3 meters of the surface of the earth. This data set is in csv format. It was created on March 11, 2020 and last updated on May 21, 2020. Original Data Dimension: 18.2M rows and 9 columns Since the data set is too large, I wouldn’t be able to directly download and import from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. For the consistency purpose mentioned above, I will first group by year and state and aggregate on 03_max_pred and O3_pop_pred columns to make the row number smaller using the query tools on the website and then import using API endpoint.\n\n\nCode\nozone &lt;- read.csv(\"https://data.cdc.gov/resource/kmf5-t9yc.csv?$query=SELECT%0A%20%20%60year2%60%2C%0A%20%20%60statefips%60%2C%0A%20%20max(%60o3_max_pred%60)%20AS%20%60max_o3_max_pred%60%2C%0A%20%20avg(%60o3_pop_pred%60)%20AS%20%60avg_o3_pop_pred%60%0AGROUP%20BY%20%60year2%60%2C%20%60statefips%60\")"

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nTo answer what are the trends in Lung and Bronchus Cancer incidence and air quality over time, we need:\n\nDescriptive Statistics: Generate basic statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.) for cancer rates, PM2.5, and ozone levels.\nTime Series Plots: Look for trends over time in each dataset. Create time series plots for cancer incidence, PM2.5, and ozone levels for each state.\n\nTo answer how do air quality and Lung and Bronchus Cancer rates vary across states, we need:\n\nBox plots to get a summary of air quality data and cancer incidence for multiple regions in a compact format. Each box plot represents a region, and the boxes display the distribution of air quality values (e.g., median, quartiles). Regions with consistently poor air quality will have lower medians and wider interquartile ranges.\nBar charts to compare cancer incidence rates for different cancer subtypes across states. Each subtype can be represented by a different color, and states can be grouped along the x-axis. As we have a large dataset about cancer incidence, we will need interactive plots to provide additional insights and allow us to zoom in on specific data points.\nHeatmap to visualize air quality data across both time and regions. Rows represent regions, columns represent time intervals, and the color scale indicates air quality levels. Consistently poor air quality regions will be represented by darker colors on the heatmap.\n\nTo answer whether there is any correlation between PM2.5 and ozone and the incidence of Lung and Bronchus cancer in different regions of the United States, we would:\n\nCompare the time series line we got for cancer incidence with the line we got for air condition. Make scatter plots to visualize the relationship between air quality indices and cancer rates.\nPerform hypothesis testing using Pearson’s correlation test and get a statistical result based on p-value."

    "text": "3.3 Correlations Cetween Lung and Bronchus Cancer and PM2.5/Ozone Concentrations\nTo explore how one variable changes with respect to the other between lung and bronchus cancer rates and PM2.5/Ozone concentrations, we used scatter plot, pearson test, and interactive parallel coordinate plot.\nThe following line of best fit in scatter plot shows that lung and bronchus cancer rates and PM2.5 are positively correlated, for most points with higher PM2.5 concentration, it also has higher cancer rate. There are some outliers with low cancer rates but diverse PM2.5 concentration added noise to the fitted line. To know details about those points, we employed interactive scatter plot and discovered that they all belong to Utah.

There are some outliers that have high ozone concentration level but low cancer rate. The fitted line is slightly downward because of those outliers. To know details about those points, we employed interactive scatter plot and again discovered that they all belong to Utah. While the average ozone concentration in Utah is consistently high comparing to other states, it also has very low lung cancer rates comparing to other states.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = avg_o3_pop_pred, y = total_cancer_rate)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Cancer Counts vs Ozone\", \n       x = \"Average Daily Ozone Concentration\",  \n       y = \"Total Cancer Rate\")\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(merged_data, x = ~avg_o3_pop_pred, y = ~total_cancer_rate,\n        color = ~as.factor(Year), text= ~States,\n        hoverinfo = 'text') \n\n\nNo trace type specified:\n  Based on info supplied, a 'scatter' trace seems appropriate.\n  Read more about this trace type -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter\n\n\nNo scatter mode specifed:\n  Setting the mode to markers\n  Read more about this attribute -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter-mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pearson correlation test provides a coefficient (r) that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. For value close to 1, it indicates positive linear correlation. Based on our data, cancer rates and PM2.5 concentration has correlation 0.4470339. It could be higher without outliers. The p value is 2.2e-16, much smaller than 0.01, which highly suggests that true correlation between lung cancer and PM2.5 concentration is not 0.\n\n\nCode\ncorrelation_test_pearson &lt;- cor.test(merged_data$total_cancer_rate, merged_data$avg_pm25_pop_pred, method = \"pearson\")\nprint(correlation_test_pearson)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  merged_data$total_cancer_rate and merged_data$avg_pm25_pop_pred\nt = 11.028, df = 487, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.3731532 0.5152807\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.4470339 \n\n\nFinally to take a look at the relationships among cancer rate, PM2.5 concentration, and Ozone concentration. It’s not clear if PM2.5 and Ozone concentration are correlated as some data shows negative relationship and some shows positive. But it’s clear that Utah always has the lowest lung and bronchus cancer rate.\n\n\nCode\nmerged_data %&gt;% \n  select(c(\"States\",\"total_cancer_rate\",\"avg_pm25_pop_pred\",\"avg_o3_pop_pred\")) %&gt;%\n  arrange(merged_data) %&gt;%\n  parcoords(rownames = FALSE,\n            brushMode = \"1D-axes\",\n            color = list(colorBy = \"Region\",\n                         colorScale = \"scaleOrdinal\",\n                         colorScheme = \"schemeCategory10\"),\n            alpha = 0.5,\n            withD3 = TRUE,\n            width = 770,\n            height = 600)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph above, we notice that there are some outliers states, here we using z-score and IQR methods to examine the states that are outliers.\n\n\nCode\nz_score &lt;- function(x) {\n  (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)\n}\n\n# Calculate Z-score for each variable\nmerged_data$z_pm25 &lt;- z_score(merged_data$avg_pm25_pop_pred)\nmerged_data$z_cancer_count &lt;- z_score(merged_data$total_cancer_rate)\n\n# Identify outliers (Z-score &gt;
