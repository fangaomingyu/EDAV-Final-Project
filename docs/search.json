    "text": "1 Introduction\nChosen Topic: “Understanding Vaccination Coverage Trends and Disparities Among Young Children Across Different Regions and Demographics”\nWe want to choose this topic as vaccination is a critical tool in preventing infectious diseases, and understanding its coverage and disparities is key to ensuring the health and well-being of children worldwide. Despite the known benefits of vaccines, there are significant disparities in vaccination coverage. These disparities can be due to a variety of factors including socio-economic status, geographical location, access to healthcare, etc. Understanding these disparities is crucial for designing targeted interventions to improve vaccination rates.\nQuestions we are interested in studying: 1. Vaccination Rate Trends Over Time: Analyze the changes in vaccination rates among young children over several years. This would help in identifying any progress or setbacks in vaccination efforts.\n\nRegional and Geographical Variations: Examine how vaccination rates vary across different regions or states. This analysis could reveal areas with lower vaccination rates that might require additional public health resources.\nDemographic Analysis: Investigate vaccination rates across different demographic groups, including age, insurance coverage, urbanicity, race/ethnicity, and poverty. This could uncover disparities in vaccine coverage and help target interventions more effectively."

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nTo answer what geographical areas in the United States have consistently poor air quality and elevated cancer rates. We would perform time series analysis and draw time series line plot. Also, we will use box plot to get a summary of air quality data for multiple regions in a compact format. Each box plot represents a region, and the boxes display the distribution of air quality values (e.g., median, quartiles). Regions with consistently poor air quality will have lower medians and wider interquartile ranges. To double check our finding, we would use heatmap to visualize air quality data across both time and regions. Rows represent regions, columns represent time intervals, and the color scale indicates air quality levels. Consistently poor air quality regions will be represented by darker colors on the heatmap."

    "text": "2.1 Technical description\nData Source 1: The first dataset we use is the United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) from the CDC’s WONDER database(https://wonder.cdc.gov/cancer-v2020.HTML). It includes cancer incidence data for the United States. These data are collected and provided by the CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. From the previous archived Cancer Statistics data, we can tell that the dataset is updated each year. The data contains 9 variables, including location, year, age group, race, sex, ethnicity, leading cancer sites, cancer sites, and childhood cancers. Also, the dataset covers years 1999 to 2020, with the 2022 data submission released in 2023. For our research, we focus on data from 2001 to 2011, centering on specific variables like sex, states, and certain cancers including brain, kidney and renal pelvis, larynx, lung, melanoma of the skin, and oral cancer. The final dimension of the cancer data is 5918 * 11. This selection enables us to analyze trends and patterns relevant to our study’s objectives. However, the dataset presents a challenge in its usage: it does not allow direct downloading in CSV format. Instead, we must employ the website’s query feature to select desired columns and export them as a TXT file. To make this data compatible with our analytical tools, we use R to transform the file into a CSV format, facilitating efficient data manipulation and analysis. This conversion process is crucial for extracting meaningful insights from the dataset, which includes data on the total population, cancer incidence, and crude rates.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read.table(file = 'United States Cancer Statistics, 2002-2011 Incidence.txt', \n                   header = TRUE, \n                   fill = TRUE, \n                   strip.white = TRUE, \n                   sep = \"\")\ndata &lt;- data[, -ncol(data)]\nnames(data)[ncol(data)] &lt;- 'Crude Rate'\nwrite_csv(data, 'cancer.csv')\n\n\nData Source 2: Daily PM2.5 Concentrations All County, 2001-2016 LINK: https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-PM2-5-Concentrations-All-County-2001-2016/7vdq-ztk9 This data set is collected by CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. It provides modeled predictions of PM2.5 levels from the EPA’s Downscaler model. Data are at the county level for year 2001-2016. The dataset includes the maximum, median, mean, and population-weighted mean of 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration in μg/m3. This data set is in csv format. It was created on March 25, 2020 and last updated on January 21, 2021. Original Data Dimension: 18.2M rows and 8 columns. Since this dataset is too large, I wouldn’t be able to directly download and import from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Also, to compare with cancer incidence over time, it’s better to let both datasets have the same time division (i.e., by year) and same geographical division(i.e., by state), it ensures consistency in the temporal granularity of the data. Thus, I will first group by year and state and aggregate on the PM25_max_pred and PM25_pop_pred columns to make the row number smaller using the query tools on the website and then import using API endpoint.\n\n\nCode\npm &lt;- read.csv(\"https://data.cdc.gov/resource/7vdq-ztk9.csv?$query=SELECT%0A%20%20%60year%60%2C%0A%20%20%60statefips%60%2C%0A%20%20max(%60pm25_max_pred%60)%20AS%20%60max_pm25_max_pred%60%2C%0A%20%20avg(%60pm25_pop_pred%60)%20AS%20%60avg_pm25_pop_pred%60%0AGROUP%20BY%20%60year%60%2C%20%60statefips%60\")\n\n\nData Source 3: Daily County-Level Ozone Concentrations, 2001-2016 LINK: https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-County-Level-Ozone-Concentrations-2001-2016/kmf5-t9yc This data set is collected by CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network.
