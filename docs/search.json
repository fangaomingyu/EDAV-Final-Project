    "text": "1 Introduction\nTitle: Investigating the Relationship Between Air Quality and Cancer Incidence in the United States\nWhy Choose This Topic:\n\nPublic Health Impact: Cancer is a leading cause of death globally, and its incidence is on the rise. Investigating the relationship between cancer and air quality can provide insights into environmental factors contributing to cancer risk.\nEnvironmental Concerns: Air quality affects the health of millions of people. Poor air quality, characterized by pollutants like particulate matter (PM) has been associated with various health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.\nPolicy Implications: Understanding the link between air quality and cancer can inform evidence-based policies and regulations aimed at reducing cancer rates by improving air quality. This research can contribute to more effective public health strategies.\n\nQuestions we are interested in studying:\n\nWhether certain cancer subtypes (e.g., lung cancer, bladder cancer) show a stronger association with poor air quality? Whether certain states have higher rate of certain cancer subtypes?\nDetermine if there are geographical areas in the United States with consistently poor air quality and elevated cancer rates. Are there particular pollutants associated with these areas?\nWhether there is a statistically significant correlation between long-term exposure to poor air quality (measured by pollutants like PM2.5, ozone, and VOCs) and the incidence of specific cancer types in different regions of the United States?\n\nContext About the Measurement of Air Quality:\nWe would assess air quality using various measurements, including:\n\nDaily Ozone Concentrations Daily ozone concentrations refer to the levels of ozone (O3) gas in the atmosphere measured on a daily basis. Ozone is a reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms (O3), and it is a key component of Earth’s atmosphere. While ozone high in the stratosphere (stratospheric ozone) plays a crucial role in protecting us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, ozone at ground level (tropospheric ozone) is an air pollutant that can have health and environmental impacts.\nDaily PM2.5 Concentrations Daily PM2.5 concentrations refer to the levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air measured on a daily basis. PM2.5 refers to tiny airborne particles or aerosols with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These particles are so small that they can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, posing health risks to humans."

    "text": "2.1 Research plan\n\nTo answer what geographical areas in the United States have consistently poor air quality. We would perform time series analysis and draw time series line plot. Also, we will use box plot to get a summary of air quality data for multiple regions in a compact format. Each box plot represents a region, and the boxes display the distribution of air quality values (e.g., median, quartiles). Regions with consistently poor air quality will have lower medians and wider interquartile ranges. To double check our finding, we would use heatmap to visualize air quality data across both time and regions. Rows represent regions, columns represent time intervals, and the color scale indicates air quality levels. Consistently poor air quality regions will be represented by darker colors on the heatmap.\nAfter knowing what geographical areas have poor air quality, we need to answer questions about whether certain states have a higher rate of specific cancer subtypes and then explore whether certain cancer subtypes show a stronger association with poor air quality. We will first draw bar charts to compare cancer incidence rates for different cancer subtypes across states. Each subtype can be represented by a different color, and states can be grouped along the x-axis. As we have a large dataset about cancer incidence, we will need interactive plots to provide additional insights and allow us to zoom in on specific data points. We would also draw time series line plot to explore the trend of cancer incidence and compare with the line we got for air condition.\nFinally to answer whether there is a statistically significant correlation between long-term exposure to poor air quality, we will first draw scatter plots can show the relationship between two continuous variables cancer incidence rates and air quality levels. And then, we will perform hypothesis testing using Pearson’s test and get a conclusion based on p-value."
