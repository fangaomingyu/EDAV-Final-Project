    "text": "1 Introduction\nTitle: Investigating the Relationship Between Air Quality and Cancer Incidence in the United States\nWhy Choose This Topic:\n\nPublic Health Impact: Cancer is a leading cause of death globally, and its incidence is on the rise. Investigating the relationship between cancer and air quality can provide insights into environmental factors contributing to cancer risk.\nEnvironmental Concerns: Air quality affects the health of millions of people. Poor air quality, characterized by pollutants like particulate matter (PM) has been associated with various health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.\nPolicy Implications: Understanding the link between air quality and cancer can inform evidence-based policies and regulations aimed at reducing cancer rates by improving air quality. This research can contribute to more effective public health strategies.\n\nQuestions we are interested in studying:\n\nWhether certain cancer subtypes (e.g., lung cancer, bladder cancer) show a stronger association with poor air quality? Whether certain states have higher rate of certain cancer subtypes?\nDetermine if there are geographical areas in the United States with consistently poor air quality and elevated cancer rates. Are there particular pollutants associated with these areas?\nWhether there is a statistically significant correlation between long-term exposure to poor air quality (measured by pollutants like PM2.5, ozone, and VOCs) and the incidence of specific cancer types in different regions of the United States?\n\nContext About the Measurement of Air Quality:\nWe would assess air quality using various measurements, including:\n\nDaily Ozone Concentrations Daily ozone concentrations refer to the levels of ozone (O3) gas in the atmosphere measured on a daily basis. Ozone is a reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms (O3), and it is a key component of Earth’s atmosphere. While ozone high in the stratosphere (stratospheric ozone) plays a crucial role in protecting us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, ozone at ground level (tropospheric ozone) is an air pollutant that can have health and environmental impacts.\nDaily PM2.5 Concentrations Daily PM2.5 concentrations refer to the levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air measured on a daily basis. PM2.5 refers to tiny airborne particles or aerosols with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These particles are so small that they can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, posing health risks to humans."

    "text": "2.1 Technical description\nData Source 1 The first dataset we use is the United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) from the CDC’s WONDER database(https://wonder.cdc.gov/cancer-v2020.HTML). It includes cancer incidence data for the United States. These data are collected and provided by the CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. From the previous archived Cancer Statistics data, we can tell that the dataset is updated each year. The data contains 9 variables, including location, year, age group, race, sex, ethnicity, leading cancer sites, cancer sites, and childhood cancers. Also, the dataset covers years 1999 to 2020, with the 2022 data submission released in 2023. One problem with the data source is that we cannot save the data as csv file directly. Instead, we need to use the query provided by the website to select the specific columns we want and save it in a txt file. For our research purpose, we only include year from 2001 to 2011, sex, states, specific cancers(Brain, kidney and renal pelvis, larynx, lung, melanoma of the skin, and oral cancer). The dataset includes the total population, the number of people who get cancer, and the crude rate. To import the data, we need to use R to transform it to csv file.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read.table(file = 'United States Cancer Statistics, 2002-2011 Incidence.txt', \n                   header = TRUE, \n                   fill = TRUE, \n                   strip.white = TRUE, \n                   sep = \"\")\ndata &lt;- data[, -ncol(data)]\nnames(data)[ncol(data)] &lt;- 'Crude Rate'\nwrite_csv(data, 'cancer.csv')\n\n\nData Source 2 Daily PM2.5 Concentrations All County, 2001-2016 LINK: https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-PM2-5-Concentrations-All-County-2001-2016/7vdq-ztk9 This data set is collected by CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. It provides modeled predictions of PM2.5 levels from the EPA’s Downscaler model. Data are at the county level for year 2001-2016. The dataset includes the maximum, median, mean, and population-weighted mean of 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration in μg/m3. This data set is in csv format. It was created on March 25, 2020 and last updated on January 21, 2021. Original Data Dimension: 18.2M rows and 8 columns. Since this dataset is too large, I wouldn’t be able to directly download and import from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Also, to compare with cancer incidence over time, it’s better to let both datasets have the same time division (i.e., by year) and same geographical division(i.e., by state), it ensures consistency in the temporal granularity of the data. Thus, I will first group by year and state and aggregate on the PM25_max_pred and PM25_pop_pred columns to make the row number smaller using the query tools on the website and then import using API endpoint.\n\n\nCode\npm &lt;- read.csv(\"https://data.cdc.gov/resource/7vdq-ztk9.csv?$query=SELECT%0A%20%20%60year%60%2C%0A%20%20%60statefips%60%2C%0A%20%20max(%60pm25_max_pred%60)%20AS%20%60max_pm25_max_pred%60%2C%0A%20%20avg(%60pm25_pop_pred%60)%20AS%20%60avg_pm25_pop_pred%60%0AGROUP%20BY%20%60year%60%2C%20%60statefips%60\")\n\n\nData Source 3 Daily County-Level Ozone Concentrations, 2001-2016 LINK: https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-County-Level-Ozone-Concentrations-2001-2016/kmf5-t9yc This data set is collected by CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. Data are at the county levels for years 2001-2014. The dataset includes the maximum, median, mean, and population-weighted mean estimated 8-hour average ozone concentration in parts per billion (ppb) within 3 meters of the surface of the earth. This data set is in csv format. It was created on March 11, 2020 and last updated on May 21, 2020. Original Data Dimension: 18.2M rows and 9 columns Since the data set is too large, I wouldn’t be able to directly download and import from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. For the consistency purpose mentioned above, I will first group by year and state and aggregate on 03_max_pred and O3_pop_pred columns to make the row number smaller using the query tools on the website and then import using API endpoint.\n\n\nCode\nozone &lt;- read.csv(\"https://data.cdc.gov/resource/kmf5-t9yc.csv?$query=SELECT%0A%20%20%60year2%60%2C%0A%20%20%60statefips%60%2C%0A%20%20max(%60o3_max_pred%60)%20AS%20%60max_o3_max_pred%60%2C%0A%20%20avg(%60o3_pop_pred%60)%20AS%20%60avg_o3_pop_pred%60%0AGROUP%20BY%20%60year2%60%2C%20%60statefips%60\")"

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nTo answer what geographical areas in the United States have consistently poor air quality and elevated cancer rates. We would perform time series analysis and draw time series line plot. Also, we will use box plot to get a summary of air quality data for multiple regions in a compact format. Each box plot represents a region, and the boxes display the distribution of air quality values (e.g., median, quartiles). Regions with consistently poor air quality will have lower medians and wider interquartile ranges. To double check our finding, we would use heatmap to visualize air quality data across both time and regions. Rows represent regions, columns represent time intervals, and the color scale indicates air quality levels. Consistently poor air quality regions will be represented by darker colors on the heatmap."
