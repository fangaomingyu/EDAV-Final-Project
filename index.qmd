# Introduction
Chosen Topic:
"Understanding Vaccination Coverage Trends and Disparities Among Young Children Across Different Regions and Demographics"

We want to choose this topic as vaccination is a critical tool in preventing infectious diseases, and understanding its coverage and disparities is key to ensuring the health and well-being of children worldwide. Despite the known benefits of vaccines, there are significant disparities in vaccination coverage. These disparities can be due to a variety of factors including socio-economic status, geographical location, access to healthcare, etc. Understanding these disparities is crucial for designing targeted interventions to improve vaccination rates.

Questions we are interested in studying:
1. Vaccination Rate Trends Over Time: Analyze the changes in vaccination rates among young children over several years. This would help in identifying any progress or setbacks in vaccination efforts.

2. Regional and Geographical Variations: Examine how vaccination rates vary across different regions or states. This analysis could reveal areas with lower vaccination rates that might require additional public health resources.

3. Demographic Analysis: Investigate vaccination rates across different demographic groups, including age, insurance coverage, urbanicity, race/ethnicity, and poverty. This could uncover disparities in vaccine coverage and help target interventions more effectively.
